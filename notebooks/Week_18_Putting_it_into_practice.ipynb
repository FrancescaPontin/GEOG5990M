    "# Data Info\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "## Consumer Vulnerability\n",
    "\n",
    "Read about the data here: https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/consumer-vulnerability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Some consumers are more vulnerable to marketing practices due to their personal traits such age, health or household makeup. This vulnerability varies by product and industry. Consumer vulnerability here is defined as the risk that a consumer’s mental, physical or financial welfare may be damaged when engaging in a market interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "While consumer vulnerability has been discussed at length in academic literature and regulatory guidelines, there has not been a comprehensive geographical assessment of consumer vulnerability in the United Kingdom. This study creates a geodemographic classification of consumer vulnerability at output area level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables selected to use for clustering were derived from 2011 Census outputs, based on the whether they suitably describe consumer vulnerability as defined above. In addition data from a commercial partner was used for cluster validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Highly correlated variables were considered for removal from the initial selection. Counts were converted to percentages for each output area. Data were then transformed using Inverse Hyperbolic Sine and standardised using z-scores. Principal component analysis was performed on the treated data before clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means was performed to cluster the data using the first 10 principal components as inputs. The optimum number of clusters was first determined by running k-means at each value of k (number of clusters) from 2 to 25. This was then used when creating the final clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimum number of 6 clusters was found using k-means. These clusters were visualised using heat maps and radial plots by comparing clusters to the z-scores of the original variables. Each of these clusters showed distinct characteristics related to consumer vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clusters were characterised as “Prosperous Professionals”, “Well Established”, “Students and Young Professionals”, “On a Budget”, “Vulnerable Communities”, and “Vulnerable Pensioners”.\n",
    "\n",
    "These cluster results were presented on an interactive map for the United Kingdom, showing cluster membership of each output area (Fig 1). Pen portraits were also written to help end users understand the characteristics of each cluster.\n",
    "A consumer dataset was used to validate the clusters, finding a good level of agreement. This involved comparing the cluster solution to key variables such as income, shop spend and holiday spend. In addition to validation this process also generated extra insight into the cluster characteristics, such as spending habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, each cluster was broken down into sub-clusters and characterised using the same methods as above. This produced further insight into the makeup of each of the clusters, further identifying areas with particular vulnerability to market practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pen Portraits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prosperous Professionals \n",
    "\n",
    "This group contains a high proportion of people in professional and technical occupations including senior positions. Home ownership in this group high, as is detached housing. There are a large number of married and cohabiting people in this cluster, in particular with children. Full time employment, very good health and 2 or more cars per household are all characteristic of this group. The proportion of people in the age range of 30-44 is high of this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The level of vulnerability for this group is considered very low as there are very few characteristics associated with vulnerability.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Well Established\n",
    "\n",
    "This group contains larger proportion of demographics age 45 and older including a large proportion of retirees and people in professional occupations. A large proportion of the non-retired workers are self-employed. The proportion of home ownership is high, as is people living in detached housing. The proportion of married and cohabiting people is high in this group. The proportion of one person households above 65 is also relatively high, as are people who provide unpaid care. People in this group typically have higher level qualifications. Households typically contain 2 or more cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The level of vulnerability for this group is considered low as overall there are few characteristics associated with vulnerability. However, the proportion of households containing a lone person over 60 and people providing unpaid care does increase vulnerability somewhat.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Students and Young Professionals\n",
    "\n",
    "This group contains a high proportion of full time students and full time employees of around ages 20 to 29. For housing the proportion of flats is high as is private rent. High levels of qualifications and professional occupations are characteristic of this group. Very good health is characteristic of this group. There reasonably high proportion of people with poor English skills in this cluster and households with no cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "This group does not exhibit many vulnerable characteristics except for poor English speakers and a lack of cars in the household.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On a Budget\n",
    "\n",
    "This group contains a high proportion of people in trades, sales, and leisure, as well as a high proportion of unemployed or long term sick/disabled. Qualification levels are generally low. The proportion of people with fair or poor health is high, as well as those with limited day to day activities. This group contains high proportions of married/cohabiting people with children and also lone parents. Semi-detached and terraced housing is characteristic of this cluster.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vulnerable Communities\n",
    "\n",
    "This group contains a high proportion of people with poor English skills, lone parents, and long term sick/disabled. Flats or terraced housing, and social renting is characteristic of this group. The health of people in this group varies. Unemployment is high and those that are in work are typically in lower paying jobs. A large proportion of homes do not have a car. The age range is young to mid-aged at around 15 to 44.\n",
    "\n",
    "This group exhibits several vulnerable characteristics suggesting a high level of vulnerability can be found in this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vulnerable Pensioners\n",
    "\n",
    "The age range for this group is around 60 to 90 with a high proportion of one person households over 65. Social rented flats are characteristic of this cluster, as is having no cars in the household. There are a high proportion of people with limited day-to-day activities, as well as fair to very bad health. The proportion of people with good health is low and with very good health is very low. People in this group who are retired or long-term sick/disabled are characteristic of this group. Those that work are typically in elementary occupations or process, plant and machine operatives.\n",

    "## Output Area Classificaiton\n",
    "\n",
    "Information taken from: https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/system/files/penportraits.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2011 Classification for Output Areas (2011 OAC) is a hierarchical geodemographic classification across the UK which identifies areas of the country with similar characteristics. The OAC is produced as a collaboration between the Office for National Statistics and University College London. The classification contains the following breakdown of Output Areas into different groups and sub-groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supergroups\n",
    "There are eight supergroups forming the top tier of the hierarchy, denoted by a number (n) before\n",
    "their name in the descriptions below. These provide the most generic descriptions of the population\n",
    "in the UK. Descriptions for supergroups that discuss the average are referring to the ‘average’\n",
    "characteristics for the UK. If not explicitly stated, comparisons (for example higher or lower) are\n",
    "made with the UK as a whole.\n",
    "#### Groups\n",
    "The middle tier is the group level, of which there are 26, each denoted by a number and letter (nx)\n",
    "in the descriptions. These provide a further description of an area’s characteristics, in addition to,\n",
    "and comparison with the parent supergroup characteristics. As the 2011 OAC is a top-down\n",
    "classification, any group that starts with the same n as a supergroup will have been derived from\n",
    "that supergroup only. The supergroups produce two to four groups each. Descriptions for groups\n",
    "that refer to the average are referring to the ‘average’ of the parent supergroup, and not the\n",
    "national average. If not explicitly stated, comparisons (for example higher or lower) are made with\n",
    "the parent supergroup.\n",
    "#### Subgroups\n",
    "The bottom tier of the 2011 OAC hierarchy is the subgroups. There are 76 of these groups each\n",
    "denoted by a number, letter and number (nxn). These descriptions supplement both the parent\n",
    "supergroup and parent group characteristics, and comparisons are made with the parent group.\n",
    "Any subgroup starting with the same nx as a group means it will have been derived from that group\n",
    "only. The groups produce two to four subgroups each. Descriptions for subgroups that refer to the\n",
    "average are referring to the average of the parent group, and not the supergroup or national\n",
    "‘average’. If not explicitly stated, comparisons (for example higher or lower) are made with the\n",
    "parent group.\n",
